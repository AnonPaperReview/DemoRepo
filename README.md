**IonoBench** is a framework for *benchmarking spatiotemporal models for ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) forecasting*. It provides a standardized dataset, evaluation protocols, and open-source model implementations to foster reproducible research and bridge the gap between ionospheric science and modern spatiotemporal deep learning.
